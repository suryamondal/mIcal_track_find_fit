# Collated File
The file `testMacro_2Deffi_approx.cc` should have the procedure to the latest collated file.
**Note:** This code was used long ago. I did not test it gain before pushing to the GitHub.

There are two functions in the file. Both should be used in progression.
```
main		: supposed to be compiled
copyHisto	: copy histograms to a usable file for GEANT4
```
The same details are provided in the code.

## Short description
The multiplicity of strips on both sides should be correlated. It means that the streangh of
the signal/avalanche should be dictate the multiplicity. Multiplicities on both side thus should not
be generated by two different `random-numbers` (i.e., if x-side has 3 strips hit, y-side should
have 3(or 2) strips hit. Generating using two different random-numbers can cause 3 stripis hit
on x-side, and 0 strip hit in y-side.)

The idea is to generate only one random-number per layer when simulating strip multiplicity.

For this inefficiency plots are generated for each strip.
- One inefficiency plot for each strip.
- If a strip has signal then the extrapolated position is filled in the respective histogram.
  (This is implemted in `ino_digi_read1.C`.)
- The plots are convoluted (or spreaded) by the resolution. The efficiency thus gets
  underestimated. I could not perform 2D convolution. So adopted a simple strategy.
  - I assumed that the RPCs are either 100% or 0% efficient, when the avalanche is
    `within the reach`.
  - When the signal is far from the strip, then it is due to very large pulses.
  - So I make strip efficiency 1 if is more than 0.6 .
- To find the button position, I used correlated inefficiency of more than 0.3 .
